# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is meant for a course project to demonstrate how to construct plots that can be used for exploratory data analysis.

## Contents
* README.md
* plot1.R - constructs a histogram showing the frequency of the variable Global Active Power in kilowatt.
* plot1.png - plot 1 saved to PNG file.
* plot2.R - constructs a line graph showing the variable Global Active Power in kilowatt and Date.
* plot2.png - plot 2 saved to PNG file.
* plot3.R - constructs a multivariate line graph showing the Sub_metering variables and Date.
* plot3.png - plot 3 saved to PNG file.
* plot4.R - constructs a panel with the graphs listed above plus a line graph showing Voltage and Date.
* plot4.png - plot 4 saved to PNG file.

## Getting Started
1. Visit the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [Individual household electric power consumption data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption) to have a general understanding of the project and variables. 
2. Download and place the [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/household_power_consumption.zip) in a ./data subdirectory.
3. Run the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to generate the graphs.
